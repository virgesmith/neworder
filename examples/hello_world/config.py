# no timeline is required in this example, but it would typically look like this:
# neworder.timeline = (start_time, end_time, [checkpoints...])

# Checks to run during the simulation
neworder.log_level = 1 # this doesnt do anything at the moment
neworder.do_checks = True
# checks only called once since there is only one timestep
neworder.checks = {
  # a do nothing-check purely for illustration - checks must evaluate to boolean 
  # Ony eval-able expressions allowed here.
  "eval": "True",
  #"exec": "a=True" # will fail, assigment is not eval-able
}

# Initialisation - construct an instance of Greet
#
# This creates an object called "greeter" within the neworder module, which is an instance of 
# the class Greet from the "greet" module and is initialised with some parameters.
# The pure python equivalent to the above is:
#   import greet
#   import neworder
#   neworder.greeter = greet.Greet("Namaste", "Bonjour", "Hola", "Annyeonghaseyo")
# args must be a tuple or a single value
# kwargs must be a dict, e.g. add
# ..., kwargs = { ... } }
neworder.initialisations = {
  "greeter": { "module": "greet", "class_": "Greet", "args": ("Namaste", "Bonjour", "Hola", "Annyeonghaseyo") }
}

# The "transition" in this case fetches the current username from the os
# Note that the code is exec'd not eval'd: any return value is discarded
neworder.transitions = { 
  "who": "greeter.get_name()"
  #"exec": "a=1" # won't fail. a is in neworder namespace
}

# Say hello when the empty simulation is done
#
# equivalent to 
# import neworder
# neworder.greeter()
# TODO control over order of execution...
neworder.checkpoints = {
  #"exec": "b=a+1", # exec - shouldn't fail. a, b are in neworder namespace, and already initialised
  #"print": "print(b)",
  "say_hello" : "greeter()",
