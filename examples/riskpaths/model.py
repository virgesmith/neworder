  'RiskPaths is a simple, competing risk, case-based continuous time microsimulation model. Its
  main use is as a teaching tool, introducing microsimulation to social scientists and demonstrating
  how dynamic microsimulation models can be efficiently programmed using the language
  Modgen.
  Modgen is a generic microsimulation programming language developed and maintained at
  Statistics Canada.
  RiskPaths as well as the Modgen programming language and other related documents are
  available at www.statcan.gc.ca/microsimulation/modgen/modgen-eng.htm'
