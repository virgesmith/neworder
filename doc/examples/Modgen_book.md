# MODGEN examples

The examples here are based on the examples given in the book [*Microsimulation and Population Dynamics*](../../README.md#references).

## Chapter 1
This is the first and simplest example - a basic cohort model using continuous-time case-based simulation of mortality (only) for a homogeneous population, using a constant mortality hazard rater. The `neworder` implementation is as direct a port of the model as possible.

The model configuration is [here](../../examples/Chapter_1/config.py) and the implementation [here](../../examples/Chapter_1/person.py)

Some example output:

## Mortality

This is based on the example in the second chapter of the book - *The Life Table*. It uses an age-specific mortality rate and has two model implementations - a direct MODGEN port: [person.py](../../examples/mortality/person.py), and a re-implementation taking advantage of python packages: [people.py](../../examples/mortality/people.py). The latter also includes a visualisation of the results:

[Mortality](../../examples/mortality/config.py).

The mortality data is sourced from the NewETHPOP[[1]](../../README.md#references) project and represents the mortality rate for white British males in one of the London Boroughs.

The "pythonic" implementation uses a pandas dataframe to store the population, as opposed to an array of `Person` objects representing each individual. This a struct-of-arrays rather than array-of-structs approach is, in this instance, far more efficient, running roughly three times quicker. It retains the basic algorithm:
- each year, sample time of death for alive individuals
- if year is not at the end of the mortality table
  - if death occurs within the year, record time of death mark individual as dead
  - otherwise, increment age by 1 and resample
- else
  - record time of death mark individual as dead
- take mean time of death

An even more efficient implementation is to sample the time of death directly using the Lewis-Shedler [[4]](../../README.md#references) "thinning" algorithm - this approach doesn't require a time loop.

## More

Although not directly taken from the book, [Competing](../../README.md#competing) and [RiskPaths](../../README.md#riskpaths) illustrate how `neworder` can be used to efficiently implement MODGEN-based models.
