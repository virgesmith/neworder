!!! note "Examples Source Code"
    The code for all the examples can be obtained by either:

    - pulling the docker image `virgesmith/neworder:latest` (more [here](/#docker)), or
    - installing neworder, downloading the source code archive from the `neworder` [releases](https://github.com/virgesmith/neworder/releases) page and extracting the `examples` subdirectory.
