!!! note "Examples Source Code"
    The code for all the examples can be obtained by either:

    - pulling the docker image `virgesmith/neworder:latest` (more [here](/#docker)), or
    - downloading the source code from the `neworder` [releases](https://github.com/virgesmith/neworder/releases) page

    If using the latter option, navigate to the `examples` subdirectory in the archive and install the dependencies required for the examples: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
