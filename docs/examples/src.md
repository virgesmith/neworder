!!! note "Examples Source Code"
    The code for all the examples can be obtained by either:

    - downloading the source code from the `neworder` [releases](https://github.com/virgesmith/neworder/releases) page
    - pulling the docker image `virgesmith/neworder:latest`. More [here](/#docker)

    The `examples` subdirectory in the archive contains a `requirements.txt` that lists the package dependencies of all the examples, which can be installed using e.g.:

    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
