# Chapter 1

The examples here are based on the examples given in the book [*Microsimulation and Population Dynamics*](../references.md).

## Implementation

This is the first and simplest example - a basic cohort model using continuous-time case-based simulation of mortality (only) for a homogeneous population, using a constant mortality hazard rate. The `neworder` implementation is as direct a port of the MODGEN model as possible.

The model configuration is [here](../../examples/chapter1/model.py) and the implementation [here](../../examples/chapter1/person.py)

Some example output:
