# API Documentation

!!! note "API documentation is no longer provided here."
    As the `neworder` package now contains type annotations, your IDE should display these automatically, e.g.:

    ![type hints](./examples/img/apidoc.png)

## Type stubs

Type stubs were generated for the core C++ library using the `pybind11-stubgen` package, with minor manual corrections. See `__init__.pyi` for details.
